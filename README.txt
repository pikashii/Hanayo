The full bot code minus the token are provided on this Github. This is because I want to promote others making their own little bots for fun too. I had trouble finding everything I needed, so I hope having it all compiled here is useful to someone!

The base code was taken off of https://discord.js.org. They have tons of resources for coding your own Discord bot in JavaScript. 

Credit to my qbb Soleil for the 'you know i had to do it to em' Hanayo image. 

If there are any issues with Hanayo spamming messages or responding when she shouldn't, please report them to me in the issues tab and I'll fix it as soon as possible.
